# Software Engineering Summative 1 - Temperature Converter Application
## Plan
The creation and implementation of a temperature conversion application within my workplace will be a simple and beneficial tool. As part of the pharmaceutical industry, this application will allow scientists in and outside of laboratories to convert in three different temperature metrics:
* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin
The Standard International (SI) unit of thermodynamic temperature is Kelvin and is often preferred by scientists as the Kelvin temperature scale begins at where 0 reflects the complete absence of thermal energy.

### Application Requirements
This application has a number of functional and non-functional requirements that can be tested against to ensure the application meets user needs and performs as expected.
Functional Requirements:

Non-Functional Requirements:


## Design

## Project Management

## Code

## Testing

## Accessibility

## Evaluation
